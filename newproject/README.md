# Ai/Ml Noise Detector

This project performs audio classification using the UrbanSound8K dataset and a neural network built with TensorFlow. The interface is developed using Streamlit for interactive inference.

## ðŸ“¦ Features

- Feature extraction using MFCC
- Model training using a CNN
- Interactive Streamlit UI for real-time audio recording and prediction
- Dataset not included due to size (8GB) â€” must be downloaded separately

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Then install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### ðŸ“¥ Download Dataset

Download the UrbanSound8K dataset manually from:
[UrbanSound8K](https://urbansounddataset.weebly.com/urbansound8k.html)

Extract it and place it in the root directory of the project as follows:

```
urbansound8k-classifier/
â”œâ”€â”€ UrbanSound8K/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ audio/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ metadata/
â”œâ”€â”€ preprocess_data.py
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py
```

### ðŸ§¹ Preprocess Data

```bash
python preprocess_data.py
```

This step extracts MFCC features and saves them in `X.npy` and `y.npy`.

### ðŸ¤– Train and Use the Model

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Use the interface to record audio and classify the sound.

## ðŸ§ª Dependencies

See `requirements.txt`.
